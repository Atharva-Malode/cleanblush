# **CleanBlush**  
*By Neural Ninjas*

## Problem Statement:  
**Healthcare Access in Rural India**  
In a country with **649,481 villages**, only **24,935 Primary Healthcare Centers (PHCs)** exist, and a mere **27%** of these have access to a dentist. This leaves millions of rural citizens vulnerable to untreated dental diseases, often traveling **100+ kilometers** just for a diagnosis.  
> **"Why should anyone wait until it’s too late or endure long journeys for basic healthcare?"**

## Our Inspiration  
Our journey began when our teammate **Chaitnya** met with an accident and lost part of his front teeth. At the clinic, he encountered a man who had traveled **150 km** from his village, suffering from white patches in his mouth for over **5 months**. Sadly, he was diagnosed with **oral submucous fibrosis (OSMF)**, a condition that could have been caught earlier with proper access to healthcare.
